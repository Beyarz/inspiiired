# [INSPIIIRED](https://beyarz.github.io/inspiiired)

This repo is all about giving inspiration & ideas for your next project.

Picking the right color combination can be hard sometimes.<br>
By trying different combinations have helped me pick the right one countless times.<br>
Manually doing it can be painful. That's why I created Inspiiired.

Inspiiired picks two random colors and adds a linear-gradient between them.<br>
To generate a new color, hit space.<br>
The rest is done for you.

If you think you've found the right combination, all you have to do next<br>
is to click on the color code and then hit the copy button.<br>
That's it!
